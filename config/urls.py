# URL resolution order matters — Django stops at the FIRST match:
#
#   1. Explicit Django views ("/", /contact/, /blog/, admin, etc.) win over
#      Wagtail pages with the same slug. A Wagtail page with slug "contact"
#      would be unreachable — pick slugs that don't collide.
#   2. path("blog/", blog_view) matches ONLY exactly /blog/. Children like
#      /blog/my-post/ fall through to the Wagtail catch-all below.
#   3. path("", include(wagtail_urls)) must stay LAST: it claims every
#      remaining URL (/portfolio/, /about/, /blog/<slug>/, ...) and 404s
#      anything that isn't a live Wagtail page.
#
# The Wagtail Site root is the tree root (see blog migration 0002), so a
# page's URL is exactly "/" + its slug path, e.g. /portfolio/my-demo/.
